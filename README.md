##  Ising Model And Markov Monte Carlo Chain 
---------------------------

The aim of this project is to show case application of Markov models to solve physical problems.  


# The Ising Model.
The Ising model can be difficult to evaluate numerically. In this project we will apply Markov Monte Carlo Chain  in evaluating the Ising Model.
