##  Ising Model And Markov Monte Carlo Chain 
---------------------------

The aim of this project is to show case application of Markov models to solve physical problems.  


### The Ising Model.
The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. It can however be difficult to evaluate numerically especially when there are many in the system . In this project we will apply Markov Monte Carlo Chain  in evaluating the Ising Model.
